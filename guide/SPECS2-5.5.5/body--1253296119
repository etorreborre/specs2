In this section we present the most important options for running specifications.

### Via sbt

The most common way to run <s2>specs2</s2> specifications is to use [sbt](http://scala-sbt.org).

[Sbt](www.scala-sbt.org) recognizes <s2>specs2</s2> as a ["test framework"](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Testing.html).
This means that any class or object extending the `Specification` class can be executed by sbt.
The `test` command will run all the specifications in your project provided you put them in the `src/test/scala` directory:
```
sbt> test
```

Most of the time however you will use the `testOnly` command, either because you want to run one specification only or because you want to pass arguments:
```
sbt> testOnly org.acme.secret.KillerAppSpec
```

Only show failed tests:
```
sbt> testOnly org.acme.secret.KillerAppSpec -- xonly
```

#### sbt options

Various sbt options can apply to [the execution of tests in sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Testing.html) but here are the ones which you are most likely to use:

 - exclude some specifications:
   `testOptions := Seq(Tests.Filter(s => Seq("Spec", "Unit").exists(s.endsWith)))`

 - execute specifications one after the other
   `Test / parallelExecution := false`

 - pass <s2>specs2</s2> arguments to all specifications
   `Test / testOptions += Tests.Argument("exclude", "integration")`

 - display results as soon as they've been executed
   `logBuffered := false`

 - restrict the parallel execution of specifications with [custom tags](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Parallel-Execution.html#Tagging+Tasks).
     ***if you want to use sbt tags you will also need to pass the `sbt.tags` argument on the command-line***

### In a shell

A specification can be executed directly with the `scala` interpreter in a shell, provided that you can produce a classpath containing all the dependencies for your project.
One way to do this is to use sbt:
```
sbt> export runtime:fullClasspath
```
Then, if you store the output of this command in an environment variable, `$SCALA_PATH`, you can run a specification with:
```
sh> scala -classpath $SCALA_PATH specs2.run org.acme.secret.KillerAppSpec
```

### Output

When you run a specification, whatever environment you are in: sbt, shell, IDE,... you can specify different outputs for the results. For example, when you execute a specification with sbt, the results appear in the console. If you want JUnit XML files to be produced instead you need to pass the `junitxml` argument. Adding any "output" argument will deactivate the console (you will see no output in the console) but you can enable it again by passing the `console` argument. You can of course specify several outputs like `html junitxml console`.

Here is a list of all the existing `Printers` in <s2>specs2</s2> with links to the corresponding section in the User Guide for more information.
