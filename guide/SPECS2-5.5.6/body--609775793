But this works for individual examples only. In some circumstances you might want to skip a whole specification.
For example, your specification needs to access a web service in order to work and this service might not be available on all testing machines.
You can skip this specification conditionally with the `skipAllIf` argument:

```
class InactiveSpec extends Specification:
  def is = skipAllIf(databaseIsDown) ^ s2"""

  There is a list of customers in the database $e1
  One of them is called Eric $e2
  """

  def e1 = database.getCustomers must not(beEmpty)
  def e2 = database.getCustomers must contain((_: Customer).name === "Eric")
```


There also is a version of `skipAllIf` which reads better for some conditions: `skipAllUnless`. already presents two methods for skipping examples.
