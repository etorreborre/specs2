```
class MySpecification extends org.specs2.mutable.Specification:
  "this is my specification" >> {
    "where example 1 must be true" >> {
      1 must ===(1)
    }
    "where example 2 must be true" >> {
      2 must ===(2)
    }
  }
```


You can also use the `should/in` syntax:

```
class MySpecification extends org.specs2.mutable.Specification:
  "this is my specification" should {
    "have one example" in {
      1 must ===(1)
    }
    "and another one" in {
      2 must ===(2)
    }
  }
```


<img src="images/icon_failure_sml.gif"/> You might get clashes with should which can also be used to declare expectations on strings:
```
class MySpecification extends org.specs2.mutable.Specification:
  "this" should {
    "will not compile because should is overloaded" in  {
      "a string" should not(beEmpty)
    }
  }
```

The easiest work around in that case is to use must for the expectation:

```
class MySpecification extends org.specs2.mutable.Specification:
  "this" should {
    "compile now" in {
      "a string" must not(beEmpty)
    }
  }
