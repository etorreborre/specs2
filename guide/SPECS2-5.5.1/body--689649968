The <s2>specs2</s2> matchers are a well-delimited piece of functionality that you should be able to reuse in your own test framework. You can reuse the following traits:

 * `org.specs2.matcher.MustMatchers` (or `org.specs2.matcher.ShouldMatchers`) to write anything like `1 must be_==(1)` and
   get a `Result` back

 * **Important**: the `MustMatchers` *trait* will fill-in stacktraces on `MatchResults` to mark the location of a result while the `MustMatchers` object will not. This has some important consequences in terms of performances because creating stack traces is expensive

 * You can also use the side-effecting version of that trait called `org.specs2.matcher.MustThrownMatchers` (or `org.specs2.matcher.ShouldThrownMatchers`).
   It throws a `FailureException` as soon as an expectation is failing

 * Finally, in a JUnit-like library you can use the `org.specs2.matcher.JUnitMustMatchers` trait which throws `AssertionFailureError`s

#### Without any dependency on specs2

It is possible to add testing features to your library without depending on a specific testing library, like <s2>specs2</s2> or ScalaTest.
You will let clients of your library decide which one they want with the following trait:

```
trait TestInterface:
  def fail(msg: String): Nothing
  def skip(msg: String): Nothing

// and use the trait in your library
trait TestKit extends TestInterface:
  def runTest(call: =>Unit) =
    // run the code and if there is an error
    fail("error!")
```


When there is a failure or an error the library will call the `TestKit` methods. Then the library client can use both the library and <s2>specs2</s2> by mixing in the
`org.specs2.matcher.ThrownMessages` trait:
```
trait ThrownMessages:
  this: ThrownExpectations =>

  def fail(m: String): Nothing = failure(m)
  def skip(m: String): Nothing = skipped(m)

class MySpec extends Specification with TestKit with ThrownMessages:
  def is = s2"""
  An example using the TestKit $e1
  """

  def e1 =
    // do something with the library
    runTest(...)
```
