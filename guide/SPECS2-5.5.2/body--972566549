When you run a specification, a `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService` is used to execute examples concurrently.
You can access this `ExecutorService` to execute futures (from Scala, Scalaz etc...), by converting it to the kind of "Execution context" required by your Future implementation.

### Scala Future

A Scala `Future` needs an implicit `ExecutionContext` to be created. You can get an execution context, out of the box, shared across all
specifications by declaring it as a class member: 

```
class MyFutureSpec(using ec: ExecutionContext) extends Specification:
  def is = s2"""
    Let's check this scala future ${Await.result(Future(1), Duration.Inf) must ===(1)}
  """

// in a mutable specification
class MyMutableFutureSpec(using ec: ExecutionContext) extends mutable.Specification:
  "Let's check this scala future" >> {
    Await.result(Future(1), Duration.Inf) must ===(1)
  }
```


You can also use an `ExecutionEnv` (from now on code examples are provided for immutable specifications only but are transposable to mutable ones): 

```
class MyFutureSpec(using ee: ExecutionEnv) extends Specification:
  def is = s2"""
    Let's check this scala future ${Await.result(Future(1), Duration.Inf) must ===(1)}
  """
```


This works thanks to an implicit conversion between `ExecutionEnv` and `ExecutionContext` provided by the
`org.specs2.execute.ImplicitExecutionContextFromExecutionEnv` trait
(this can be deactivated by mixing-in the `NoImplicitExecutionContextFromExecutionEnv` trait).

It is actually better to use an `ExecutionEnv` anyway because it is required when you want to
