Acceptance specifications are displayed in the console almost as they are in `.scala` files thanks to interpolated strings. However it is not obvious to know how to change the display of a unit specification. How do you add a new line after an example? After the specification title? How do you indent a group of examples a bit more?

First of all, you can always add a piece text by using the `txt` method on a `String`:

```
class UnitSpec extends mutable.Specification:
  """
  This is a long and important introduction to this specification.
  The examples below show everything you can do with the system.
  """.txt
```


Then if you want to add new lines you can use:

 - `br` ("break") to add a newline after any fragment, text, example...
 - `p` ("paragraph") to make a new paragraph with a break before and 2 after
<br/><br/>

Texts, or blocks of examples can also get a special indentation by using the `tab` and `backtab` methods:

```
class UnitSpec extends mutable.Specification:
  """
  This is a long and important introduction to this specification.
  """.txt
  
  """
  The examples below show everything you can do with the system.
  """.txt.tab(3) // indent the text with 3 tabs compared to the previous text
```
