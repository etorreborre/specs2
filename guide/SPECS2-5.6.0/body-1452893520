In a `s2` string the description of an example is taken as all the text having the same indentation before the example body:

```
s2"""
This is the introduction paragraph
Which presents the examples
  the first example has one line $ok

  the second example has
  more than one line $ok
"""
```


This prints
```
This is the introduction paragraph
Which presents the examples
  + the first example has one line

  + the second example has
    more than one line
```

If you want the example description to be unevenly aligned you can use a margin `|`:

```
s2"""
This is the introduction paragraph
Which presents the examples
  |this example has a very
  | very very
  |   specific indentation $ok
"""
```


This prints
```
This is the introduction paragraph
Which presents the examples
  + this example has a very
     very very
       specific indentation
```
