It is possible to include pieces of code in your documentation with the `org.specs2.specification.Snippets` trait using the `snippet` method to capture a block code with marker comments to delimit the parts you want to show.

What does this look like?

#### Snippet

Here is an example of using the `snippet` method:

```
s2"""
This is a multi-line string with a code snippet: ${snippet{
def factorial(n: Int): Int = if (n == 1) n else (n * factorial(n - 1))
factorial(3) == 6
}}
"""
```

When you use the `snippet` method, the reports will show:

This is a multi-line string with a code snippet:

```
def factorial(n: Int): Int = if (n == 1) n else (n * factorial(n - 1))
factorial(3) == 6
```

#### Cuts

Since snippets are compiled code, you might have to include many declarations, like imports or variables definitions to make the code compile. This can make your documentation more verbose than necessary so you can hide those definitions by delimiting the code to show with some comments of the form `// 8<--`:

```
s2"""
This is a snippet of code with one relevant line: ${snippet{
// 8<--
def factorial(n: Int): Int = if (n == 1) n else (n * factorial(n - 1))
// 8<--
factorial(3) == 6
// 8<--
}}
"""
```

The snippet above will only show `factorial(3) == 6`. You can repeat this pattern several times:

```
s2"""
This is a snippet of code with 2 relevant lines: ${snippet{
// 8<--
def factorial(n: Int): Int = if (n == 1) n else (n * factorial(n - 1))
// 8<--
factorial(3) == 6
// 8<--
val n = 4
// 8<--
factorial(n) == 24
}}
"""
```

This just displays:

```
factorial(3) == 6
factorial(n) == 24
```

#### Evaluation

By default the last value of a Snippet is not shown but you can display it with the `eval` method:

```
s2"""
This is a snippet of code with a result: ${snippet{
factorial(3)
}.eval}
"""
```

This displays:

```
factorial(3)
```
```
> 6
```

#### Offsets

It is possible to adjust the margin of captured source code by adding or removing whitespace:

```
s2"""
This is a snippet of code with a negative offset to align the code to the border of the screen: ${snippet{
   def factorial(n: Int): Int = if (n == 1) n else (n * factorial(n - 1))
   factorial(3)
}.offsetIs(-3)}
"""
```

This displays:

```
factorial(3)
```

#### Parameters

All of the settings above: cuts, offset,... are coming from an given `SnippetParams` instance that is changing the
behavior of the created Snippets. You can choose, for a given scope, to replace these parameters with other ones and
simply shadow the default parameters with your own, for example to always evaluate the snippets results:
```
given SnippetParams[T] = SnippetParams(evalCode = true)
```
The parameters you can set are:

name              | description
----------------- | ----------------
 `trimExpression` | function that is trimming the expression from newlines or accolades
 `cutter`         | function to remove parts which must not be shown
 `asCode`         | function to render the resulting text (as Markdown for example)
 `prompt`         | function to display the evaluated result with a prompt
 `evalCode`       | boolean indicating if a snippet must be evaluated
 `verify`         | function checking the snippet value
