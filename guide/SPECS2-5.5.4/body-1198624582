You actually might want to create your own trait extending `BeforeSpec` in order to reuse this action in more than one specification:

```
trait DatabaseSetup extends BeforeSpec:
  def beforeSpec = step(println("prepare database"))

class DatabaseSpecification1 extends Specification with DatabaseSetup:
  def is = s2"""
  // do something with the database
"""
```


How does this work? The `BeforeSpec` trait overrides a method called `map` in the `SpecificationStructure` trait (a parent of `Specification`)
and adds the fragments defined by `beforeSpec` before anything else in the specification:
```
override def map(fs: =>Fragments): Fragments =
  // the AlwaysTag is there to make sure that those fragments are always executed
  // even if we filter by name or other tags
  super.map(fs).prepend(beforeSpec.append(fragmentFactory.markAs(AlwaysTag)))
```


The `map` method is indeed called every time the specification returns the list of `Fragment`s defining it. You can leverage this method and define your own "Specification templates":

 - adding some text before/after a Specification
 - filtering out some undesirable fragments
 - reformatting all text
 - ...
