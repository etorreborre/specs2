### Parallel by default

<s2>specs2</s2> examples are executed concurrently by default:

 - this makes the execution faster

 - it encourages to write independent examples when the result of a given example should not be influenced by others

Starting from this default you can progressively add constraints to get more control over the execution.

### Steps

A `Step` is an action which can be executed anywhere in a specification. When you declare a `Step` like this:

```
class StepSpec extends Specification:
  def is = s2"""

  this is example 1 $ok
  this is example 2 $ok
  ${step(success("stop here for a second"))}

  this is example 3 $ok
  this is example 4 $ok
  """
```


Then the specification will:

  1. execute examples 1 and 2 in parallel
  2. execute the step
  3. execute examples 3 and 4 in parallel

  this is example 3 $ok

```

### Steps

A `Step` is an action which can be executed anywhere in a specification. When you declare a `Step` like this:

```
class StepSpec extends Specification:
  def is = s2"""

  this is example 1 $ok
  this is example 2 $ok
  ${step(success("stop here for a second"))}

  this is example 3 $ok
  this is example 4 $ok
  """
```


Then the specification will:

  1. execute examples 1 and 2 in parallel
  2. execute the step
  3. execute examples 3 and 4 in parallel
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

There is no "result" for a step but if it throws an Exception an `Error` will be reported. This will not however stop the execution of the rest of the specification.

### Stop the execution

You can still control if the rest of the specification must be executed by adding some constraints on the step. For example:

```
class StepWithStopOnErrorSpec extends Specification:
  def is = s2"""

  this is example 1 $ok
  this is example 2 $ok
  ${step { sys.error("sorry!"); ko("stop here for a second") }.stopOnError}

  this is example 3 $ok
  this is example 4 $ok
  """
```


When this specification is executed examples 3 and 4 will be skipped because the step returns an `Error`. An `Error` is likely to be a fatal condition but you can use other methods to stop the execution:

 - `stopOnFail` stop if there is a failure in the previous examples or in the step
 - `stopOnSkipped` stop if there is a skipped result in the previous examples or in the step
 - `stopWhen(Result => Boolean)` stop if the and-ed result of the previous examples and the step verifies a given condition

### Sequential

If your specification is a list of well-ordered examples you can use the `sequential` argument to make sure that they are executed in order:

```
class SequentialSpec extends Specification:
  def is = sequential ^ s2"""

  this is example 1 $ok
  this is example 2 $ok
  this is example 3 $ok
  this is example 4 $ok
  """
```


Thanks to the `sequential` argument the 4 examples above will execute one after the other.

### Action

Finally if you want to execute "silent" actions, like steps, but with no impact on the sequencing of the specification, you can use an `Action`:

```
class ActionSpec extends Specification:
  def is = s2"""

  this is example 1 $ok
  this is example 2 $ok

  // this will only be reported if there is a failure
  ${action(ok("do something here"))}

  this is example 3 $ok
  this is example 4 $ok
  """
```
