You can implement your own reporting of <s2>specs2</s2> specifications:

 - using the `Notifier` trait which acts like a listener
 - using a `Printer` which gives you more flexibility for reporting exactly what you want
 - using a `Reporter` which allow you to even change the default flow for reporting specifications: selection -> execution -> printing

## Notifier

The `org.specs2.reporter.Notifier` trait can be used to report execution events. It notifies of the following:

 Event                | Description
 -------------------- | -----------
 specification start  | the beginning of a specification, with its name
 specification end    | the end of a specification, with its name
 context start        | the beginning of a sub-level when the specification is seen as a tree or Fragments
 context end          | the end of a sub-level when the specification is seen as a tree or Fragments
 text                 | any Text fragment that needs to be displayed
 example start        | the beginning of an example
 example result       | `success / failure / error / skipped / pending`

All those notifications come with a location (to trace back to the originating fragment in the Specification) and a duration when relevant (i.e. for examples).

You can then using the `notifier` argument to pass the name of your custom notifier:
```
sbt> testOnly *BinarySpec* -- notifier org.acme.reporting.FtpNotifier
```

## Printer

The `org.specs2.reporter.Printer` trait defines how to output each fragment of the specification. The only method to implement is:
```
def fold(env: Env, spec: SpecStructure): Fold[Fragment]
```

So what you need to create is a `Fold` over the executing specification. What is it? A `Fold` is composed of 3 operations:
```
trait Fold[M[_], A, B]:
  type S
  def start: M[S]
  def fold: (S, A) => S
  def end(s: S): M[B]
```

 * `start` is an initial state of type `S`. By using some state you can accumulate information about the execution of the whole specification
 * `fold` is the function calculating the next state based on the current `Fragment` and the previous state
 * `end` take the last state and returns a computation doing the last action like reporting the final statistics

Once you've defined your `Printer` trait you can use the `printer` argument like so:
```
sbt> testOnly *BinarySpec* -- printer org.acme.reporting.LatexPrinter
```

## Reporter

The `org.specs2.reporter.Reporter` trait defines the full lifecycle for running specifications:
```
// prepare the environment before any reporting
def prepare(env: Env, printers: List[Printer]): List[SpecStructure] => Action[Unit]

// finalize the reporting (to save overall statistics for example)
def finalize(env: Env, printers: List[Printer]): List[SpecStructure] => Action[Unit]

/**
 * report a spec structure with the given printers
 *
 * The default implementation selects fragments to execute, executes them and uses the printers to
 * display results
 */
def report(env: Env, printers: List[Printer]): SpecStructure => Action[Unit]
```

## Troubleshooting

If your custom `Notifier` or `Printer` fails to be instantiated you can re-run the execution with the `verbose` argument in order to get an error message and a stack trace.
