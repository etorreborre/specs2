class DataTablesSpec extends Specification with DataTables with ResultMatchers { def is = s2"""

 DataTables are useful to specify lots of examples varying just by a few values.

  A simple table can be declared to specify the addition on Integers                                         $e1
  A table is not executed if there is no 'play' sign `|>` declared on it                                     $e2
  If there are failures on rows they must be reported                                                        $e3
  If there is an exception on any row, it will not stop the example                                          $e4
  If the first value is a string, !! can be used as a cell separator                                         $e5
  !! can be used as a cell separator with any type                                                           $e6
  A table can be built with just one column                                                                  $e7
  A table must work with values of different subtypes of the first row                                       $e8
  A table must work ok in a mutable spec                                                                     $e9
  A table must be formatted with equal-length cells
    when succeeding                                                                                          $e10
    when failing                                                                                             $e11
  2 tables results can be and-ed together                                                                    $e12
  a cell can have null values                                                                                $e13

 Applicative style
 =================

 The default execution model for DataTables is sequential. You can however execute the rows of a DataTable
   by using `|*` and the execution function                                                                  $applicative1
   `|*>` can be used to specify concurrent execution + `play`                                                $applicative2
   by using an applicative result type, like `Future` and the `|@` operator                                  $applicative3
   `|@>` can be used to specify concurrent execution + `play`                                                $applicative4
   A call to |* returns (es: ExecutorService) => Result                                                      $applicative5

 Even if the execution is concurrent you will get the errors corresponding to each row                       $applicative6
                                                                                                             """
