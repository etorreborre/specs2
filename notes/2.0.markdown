Major release! Please read [this post](http://etorreborre.blogspot.com/interpolated.html) to get all the details.

New features

 * simplified the acceptance specifications with [interpolated strings](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/blob/master/src/test/scala/examples/HelloWorldSpec.scala) and [`Scripts`](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/blob/master/src/test/scala/examples/ScriptedHelloWorldSpec.scala)
 * added a new way of declaring Given/When/Then specifications with the `GWT` trait (http://etorreborre.github.com/specs2/guide/org.specs2.structure.GivenWhenThenPage.html)
 * added a `Snippets` trait to insert blocks of code in generated documentation
 * added matchers for `scala.util.Try` instances
 * using the official Scalaz 7 release
 * refactored the generated html with [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap)
 * reworked the `Traversable` matchers to make a more general use of `contain`
 
Improvements
 
 * when a result is Skipped or Pending in a ScalaCheck property the full property is skipped or pending
 * restricted the JsonMatchers to strings instead of being `Matcher[Any]`
 * update `copySpecResources/unjar` to support not alphanumerical paths (e.g. Windows path with accent, thanks @cchantep)
 * added a `pegdownExtensions` argument to specify the Markdown extensions with pegdown (thanks @asflierl)
 * added a `Fixture` trait to pass data to each `Example`
 * added auto-numbered groups and examples for the `Groups` and `Grouped` traits
 * restricted the JsonMatchers to string inputs
 * added a `Tables` trait in the `specification` package to use `DataTables` without the `!` implicit creating examples

 * made the Json matchers more tolerant against single quoted Json for testing
 * when a title is specified on a Specification the url of the html file should not be changed

 * throw an `ErrorException` when a nested `forall` throws an `Exception`
 * set the `MatchResult[T].apply` method as private to specs2 to mitigate issues with semi-column inference [#154](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/154)
 * fixed the use of a custom equality matcher for different combinations of `contain(...).inOrder` and `contain(...).only`
 * fixed the or combinator for results when there are `FailureExceptions`
