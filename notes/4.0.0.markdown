Dependency-free version!

`specs2-core` is finally dependency-free and doesn't need to be built for various versions of Scalaz.
`specs2-core` is also now available for Scala.js


## Changes

 * **project** dropped the support for Scala `2.10`
 * **core** removed the dependency on Scalaz, there is now a `specs2-fp` module implementing a small amount of FP concepts
   to support the internal implementation of specs2 itself
 * **scalaz** moved `DisjunctionMatchers` and `ValidationMatchers` to that module
 * **scalaz** dropped the support for scalaz `7.0`

## Improvements

 * introduced a `org.specs2.specification.Retries` trait extending `AroundEach` to retry each example
 * introduced `org.specs2.specification.core.OwnEnv/OwnExecutionEnv` traits to isolate the execution environments of
   some specifications
 * added `addSections` to "unit" specifications to enclose each block with `section` markers and allow it to be selected
   with `include` on the command line
 * *form* display the actual value instead of the expected one for a `Prop` (this might be revisited in the future)

## Fixes

 * fixed the execution with `stopOnXXX` arguments for a sequential spec
