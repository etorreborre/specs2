Maintenance version.

Two reminders: 

 - you should depend on `specs2-core` and other specific specs2 jars instead of depending on the full `specs2` jar
 - if you depend on the full `specs2` jar or on `specs2-matcher-extra` then you need to add `"bintray" at "http://dl.bintray.com/scalaz/releases"` to your resolvers

## Features
 
 * added a `beCloseTo(100.13 within 2.significantFigures)` matcher (by @FrontierOtr) [#303](http://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/303)


## Improvements 
 
 * check the difference of collections only at report time
 * improve the speed of collection differences: added optimization in the n^2 loop of `findBestMatch` (by @mustajarvi) [#300](http://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/300)

## Fixes

 * Fixed a typo in Context.scala (by Artem Pyanykh) [#302](http://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/302)
