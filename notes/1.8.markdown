This version adds new features on top of 1.7.1:

 * added traits to selectively remove implicits: `NoMustExpectations`, `NoShouldExpectations`, `NoBooleanAutoExamples`, `NoArgProperties`, `NoDebug`, `NoPendingUntilFixed`, `NoContexts`  
 * added an `Analysis` to specify dependencies between packages (using the classycle project)
 * DataTables can now be used as an example without giving a description. The DataTable itself will be used as the example description
 * `contain` matchers can now be adapted to allow a more flexible definition of "containment"
 * reworked the Matchers guide with tabs to get an easier access to all the matchers documentation
 * upgraded to Mockito 1.9.0 (inline stubbing + verification ignoring stubbed methods)
 * added the `\>` and `\>~` xml matchers to match Text nodes (aliases: `textIs`, `textMatches`)
 * issue 55: added system exit codes on the `ClassRunner` `main` method
 
And some fixes:

 * fixed the creation of the table of contents when there are linked specifications
 * fixed issue 51: specify a partial match for `ParserMatchers`
 * fixed issue 52: added a `there was no(mock).interaction` expression (corresponding to Mockito's `verifyZeroInteractions`)
 * fixed issue 54: reporting the data frequencies when using ScalaCheck
