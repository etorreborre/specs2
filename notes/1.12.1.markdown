This version is mostly a maintenance release:

 * fixed a [step evaluation issue](http://bit.ly/NwiRxA) when working with JUnit
 * AssertionErrors are now considered as failures when coming from JUnit and real errors otherwise
 * PendingUntilFixed works with AssertionErrors ([issue 97](http://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/97))
 * the messages for the `containTheSameElementsAs` matcher are more explicit
 
And there is one small feature:

 * `beBetween` checks if a number (or anything with an `Ordering`) is between 2 others: 

    `5 must beBetween(3, 6)`
