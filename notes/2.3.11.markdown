Maintenance version

## Improvements

 * added await on `Future[T : AsResult]` to directly return a result [#241](http://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/241)
 * added a `NoStdOutAroundExample` trait to remove any console output during an example execution`
 * added an `onDistinctValues` on `contain` matchers to specify that checks must apply to distinct values. Changed the implementation of `allOf` to be `onDistinctValues(false)` so that `Seq(1) must contain(allOf(1, 1)` will not fail. For a match on distinct values, use `Seq(1) must contain(allOf(1, 1)).onDistinctValues` or Seq(1) must contain(eachOf(1, 1))`
 * added the stacktrace of the caught exception in the failure message of a `throwA[Exception]` matcher [#250](http://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/250)

## Deprecations

 * `matcher.toSet`, `matcher.toSeq`, `matcher.forall`... are now deprecated since they can be expressed more clearly by using collection matchers

## Fixes

 * fixed `contain` matchers when using them with `not`
 * documented the use of argThat [#240](http://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/240)
 * fixed the `or` combinator on `MatchResult` when the first evaluation throws an Exception
 * fixed the `AllExpectations` trait when an evaluation throws an Exception
 * fixed the use of DataTables in mutable specifications when [the datatable is successful and there are following expectations](http://bit.ly/1kqbVj9)
 * added back the missing `specs2.files` object
