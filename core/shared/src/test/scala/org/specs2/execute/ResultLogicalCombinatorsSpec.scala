 Multiple results can be or-ed
 ${success or success}

 ${(failure or failure) must beFailing}
 ${success or failure or failure}

 ${success or failure or failure}
 ${failure or success or success}
 ${success or success or success}

 Even when some of them throw FailureExceptions
 ${(success or failure1) must beSuccessful}
 ${(failure1 or success) must beSuccessful}
 ${(failure1 or failure1) must beFailing}
 ${(success or failure1 or failure1) must beSuccessful}
 ${(failure1 or success or failure1) must beSuccessful}
 ${(failure1 or failure1 or success) must beSuccessful}

 And results
 ${(pending1 and pending2) === pending1}

 A result can be evaluated only when a condition is true
 ${failure.when(false) must beSuccessful}

 A result can be evaluated only when a condition is false
 ${failure.unless(true) must beSuccessful}
