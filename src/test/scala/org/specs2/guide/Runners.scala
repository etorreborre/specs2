### Presentation

There are many ways to execute ***specs2*** specifications:

 * on the command line, with a console output, and the `specs2.run` runner
 * on the command line, with a html output, and the `specs2.html` runner
 * on the command line, with a console or a html output, and the `specs2.files` runner
 * using [Intellij IDEA](http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/SCA/Scala+Plugin+for+IntelliJ+IDEA)
 * using [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org)
 * using [JUnit](http://www.junit.org)
 * using [Maven](http://maven.apache.org)
 * using your own reporting tool implementing the `Notifier` interface (simple) or the `Exporter` interface (with a full access to the executed specification)

### Dependencies

 ***specs2*** is available for Scala 2.10 onwards and uses the following libraries, as specified using the [sbt dsl](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Library-Dependencies.html):

### Arguments

You can specify arguments which will control the execution and reporting. They can be passed on the command line, or declared inside the specification, using the `args(name=value)` syntax: ${snippet {

class MySpec extends Specification { def is = args(xonly=true) ^ s2"""
  Clever spec title
  And some intro text
  brilliant expectation $success                                   """
}
}}

##### Most/Least frequently used arguments

Most of the arguments above can be set in a specification with `args(name=value)`. However Scala would not allow the `args` method to accept *all* the possible
arguments as parameters (because a method can only have up to 22 parameters). This is why the least frequently used arguments (not in italics) can be set with an object called `args`, having separate methods for setting all the parameters, by "category". For example: ${snippet{

args.select(specName = ".*Test", include="slow")
args.execute(threadsNb = 2)
args.report(showtimes = true, xonly = true)
}}

##### Shortcuts

There are some available shortcuts for some arguments

##### Output directory

All the files created during the execution of a specification will be created in the `target/specs-report` directory. You can change that by setting the
`-Dspecs2.outDir` system property.

##### Storing previous results

When a specification has been executed its statistics and failed examples will be stored by default in a specific `stats` directory created in the output directory. This data can be used on subsequent runs to:

 * display trends in statistics
 * compute the statuses of the links of an index page
 * select only previously failed examples for execution

You can either:

  * disable this functionality (for performance reasons for example) with the `args.store(never=true)` argument (or `neverstore` on the command line)
  * reset the previous statistics with the `args.store(reset=true)` argument (or `resetstore` on the command line)

The statistics directory can also be redefined independently of the output directory with the `specs2.statsDir` system variable.

##### Status flags

The `was` and `showOnly` arguments expect a String made of "status flags". For example, `xonly` is equivalent to `showOnly("x!")`. Here is the list of all the flags which you can use to control the selection of fragments before execution or their display:

  Flag | Description
 ----- | ------------
  `+`  | successful example
  `x`  | failed example
  `!`  | error example
  `o`  | skipped example
  `*`  | pending example
  `-`  | text
  `1`  | statistics


##### Diffs

For the diffs arguments the values you can specify are:

  * `show` will not show anything (default is true)
  * `separators` allows to change the separators used to show the differences (default is "[]")
  * `triggerSize` controls the size above which the differences must be shown (default is 20)
  * `shortenSize` controls the number of characters to display around each difference (default is 5)
  * `diffRatio` percentage of differences above which the differences must not be shown (default is 30)
  * `full` displays the full original expected and actual strings

You can also specify your own enhanced algorithm for displaying difference by providing an instance of the `${fullName[Diffs]}` trait:

```
trait Diffs {
  /** @return true if the differences must be shown */
  def show: Boolean
  /** @return true if the differences must be shown for 2 different strings */
  def show(expected: String, actual: String): Boolean
  /** @return the diffs */
  def showDiffs(expected: String, actual: String): (String, String)
  /** @return true if the full strings must also be shown */
  def showFull: Boolean
}
```

##### StackTraceFilter

The `traceFilter` argument takes an instance of the `org.specs2.control.StackTraceFilter` trait to define how stacktraces should be filtered in a report. By default the `DefaultStackTraceFilter` filter will exclude lines matching the following packages:

 * `org.specs2`
 * `scalaz\\.`
 * `scala\\.`, `java\\.`
 * `sbt\\.`, `com.intellij`, `org.eclipse.jdt`, `org.junit`

If this is not what you want, you can either:

 * use `includeTrace(patterns: String*)` to create a new `StackTraceFilter` which will include only the traces matching
   those patterns
 * use `excludeTrace(patterns: String*)` to create a new `StackTraceFilter` which will exclude only the traces matching
   those patterns
 * use `includeAlsoTrace(patterns: String*)` to add new include patterns to the `DefaultStackTraceFilter`
 * use `excludeAlsoTrace(patterns: String*)` to add new exclude patterns to the `DefaultStackTraceFilter`
 * use the `org.specs2.control.IncludeExcludeStackTraceFilter` class to define both include and exclude patterns
 * define your own logic by extending the `org.specs2.control.StackTraceFilter`

Note that the default filter also truncates the stacktrace in the middle if it is bigger than 1000 lines to avoid reports being filled by out-of-control stacktraces. If you still want to see those lines you can re-run with the `fullstacktrace` argument.

#### Command line

On the command line you can pass the following arguments:

_[`regexp` is a Java regular expression, csv a list of comma-separated values, map is a list of csv pairs key:value]_

Note that any argument accepting values (like `include`) can be passed with a dash when those values contain spaces:

    >test-only TaggedSpec -- -include issue 123 -- other arguments

And as you can see above, `--` can be used to signal the end of some argument values

#### System properties

You can pass any argument to ***specs2*** from system properties. This is particularly useful for passing arguments to JUnit runners:

 * for a boolean argument, you need to pass `-Dspecs2.name` or `-Dname`
 * for a string argument, you need to pass `-Dspecs2.name=value` or `-Dname=value`

While the format `-Dname=value` can be convenient, `-Dspecs2.name=value` is recommended to avoid conflicts with other libraries.

### In the shell

#### Console output

Executing a specification `com.company.SpecName` in the console is very easy:

```
scala -cp ... specs2.run com.company.SpecName [argument1 argument2 ...]
```

#### Html output

If you want html pages to be produced for your specification you'll need to execute:

```
scala -cp ... specs2.html com.company.SpecName [argument1 argument2 ...]
```

#### JUnit XML output

Many Continuous Integration systems rely on JUnit XML reports to display build and test results. It is possible to produce
those result by using the `specs2.junitxml` object:

```
scala -cp ... specs2.junitxml com.company.SpecName [argument1 argument2 ...]
```

#### Files Runner

The `specs2.files` object will, by default, select and execute Specifications found in the test source directory:

 * the source directory is defined as `src/test/scala` but can be changed by adjusting the system property `specs2.srcTestDir`
 * the specifications files are selected as classes or object which names match `.*Spec`. This value can be changed by
   passing a different `specName` value as a command-line argument
 * `console`, `html`, `junitxml`, `markup` has to be passed on the command-line to specify which kind of output you want

You can also extend the `org.specs2.runner.FilesRunner` trait and override its behavior to implement something more appropriate
to your environment if necessary.

Additionally you can use the following arguments to modify the behavior of the `FilesRunner` object:

 * `filesrunner.verbose`: display information messages about which classes are found and being instantiated to be executed (false by default)
 * `filesrunner.basePath`: source directory containing the specifications (src/test/scala by default)
 * `filesrunner.path`: glob pattern used to find specification source files (**/*.scala by default)
 * `filesrunner.pattern`: regular expression for locating specification names inside a source file (.*Spec by default)

### In the console

The `specs2.run` object has an `apply` method to execute specifications from the Scala console:

    scala> specs2.run(spec1, spec2)

    scala> import specs2._  // same thing, importing the run object
    scala> run(spec1, spec2)

If you want to pass specific arguments you can import the `specs2.arguments` object member functions:

    scala> import specs2.arguments._

    scala> specs2.run(spec1)(nocolor)

Or you can set implicit arguments which will be used for any specification execution:

```
scala> import specs2.arguments._
scala> implicit val myargs = nocolor

scala> specs2.run(spec1)
```

### Via SBT

#### with sbt 0.7.x

In order to use ***specs2*** with sbt 0.7.x you need first to add the following lines to your sbt project:

    def specs2Framework = new TestFramework("org.specs2.runner.SpecsFramework")
    override def testFrameworks = super.testFrameworks ++ Seq(specs2Framework)

Then, depending on the naming of your specification, you have to specify which classes you want to include for reporting:

```
override def includeTest(s: String) = { s.endsWith("Spec") || s.contains("UserGuide") }
```

#### with sbt > 0.9.x

In this case you don't need to do much because ***specs2*** will be recognized out-of-the-box. However, if you want to filter some specifications you need to add this to your `build.sbt` file (see [here](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Detailed-Topics/Testing.html) for more information):

    // keep only specifications ending with Spec or Unit
    testOptions := Seq(Tests.Filter(s => Seq("Spec", "Unit").exists(s.endsWith(_))))

If you don't want the specifications to be executed in parallel:

    parallelExecution in Test := false

If you want to pass arguments available for all specifications:

    // equivalent to `test-only -- nocolor neverstore` on the command line
    testOptions in Test += Tests.Argument("nocolor", "neverstore")

    // equivalent to `test-only -- exclude integration` on the command line
    testOptions in Test += Tests.Argument("exclude", "integration")

If you want the examples results to be displayed as soon as they've been executed you need to add:

```
logBuffered := false
```

##### Test-only arguments

When you execute one test only, you can pass the arguments on the command line:

```
> test-only org.specs2.UserGuide -- xonly
```

##### Output formats

###### Html

The `html` argument is available with sbt to allow the creation of the html report from the command line.

```
> test-only org.specs2.UserGuide -- html

// in your build.sbt file
testOptions in Test += Tests.Argument("html")
```

###### Markdown

The `markup` argument can be used to create ".md" files (to use with websites like GitHub):

    > test-only org.specs2.UserGuide -- markup

In this case the markup text in the Specifications is not interpreted.

###### JUnit

Similarly, JUnit xml output files can be created by passing the `junitxml` option:

```
> test-only org.specs2.examples.HelloWorldUnitSpec -- junitxml

// in your build.sbt file
testOptions in Test += Tests.Argument("junitxml")
```

###### Console

If you want to get a console output as well, don't forget to add the `console` argument:

```
> test-only org.specs2.UserGuide -- html console

// in your build.sbt file
testOptions in Test += Tests.Argument("html", "console")
```

##### Files runner

Any `FilesRunner` object can also be invoked by sbt, but you need to specify `console`, `html`, `junitxml`, `markup` on the command line:

```
> test-only allSpecs -- console
```

##### Colors

By default, the reporting will output colors. If you're running on windows you might either:

 * use the [following tip](http://www.marioawad.com/2010/11/16/ansi-command-line-colors-under-windows) to install colors in the DOS console
 * or pass `nocolor` as a command line argument

Then, there are different ways to set-up the colors you want to use for the output

*From system properties*

The so-called "SmartColors" argument will check if there are colors defined as specs2 properties. If so, the colors  used
to output text in the Console will be extracted from those properties:

e.g. `-Dspecs2.color.failure=m` will use magenta for failures.

The property names and default values are:

Property        | Default value |
--------------- |  ------------ |
`color.text`    |  white        |
`color.success` |  green        |
`color.failure` |  yellow       |
`color.error`   |  red          |
`color.pending` |  blue         |
`color.skipped` |  cyan         |
`color.stats`   |  blue         |

The default values above are provided for a black background. If you have a white background you can use the `specs2.whitebg` property and then the default values will be:

Property        | Default value |
--------------- |  ------------ |
`color.text`    |  black        |
`color.success` |  green        |
`color.failure` |  magenta      |
`color.error`   |  red          |
`color.pending` |  blue         |
`color.skipped` |  cyan         |
`color.stats`   |  blue         |

All the available colors are listed here, with their corresponding abbreviation which you can use to refer to them as well:

 Color   | Abbreviation |
 ------  | ------------ |
 white   | w            |
 green   | g            |
 yellow  | y            |
 red     | r            |
 blue    | be           |
 cyan    | c            |
 black   | bk           |
 magenta | m            |


*From command-line arguments*

It is also possible to set colors by passing the `colors` argument. This argument must be a list of `key:value` pairs (comma-separated) where keys are taken from the property names above without the `color.` prefix and values from the abbreviated color names.

For example you can pass on the command line:

 `colors text:blue,failure:magenta`

 to have the text colored in blue and the failures in Magenta.

If the `colors` option contains `whitebg` then the default colors are considered to be [`InvertedColors`](${API_DIR}index.html#org.specs2.text.Colors)

*Through the API*

Finally you can change the color scheme that's being used on the console by implementing your own [`org.specs2.text.Colors`](${API_DIR}index.html#org.specs2.text.Colors) trait or override values in the existing `ConsoleColors` class. For example if you want to output magenta everywhere yellow is used you can write:

    object MyColors = new org.specs2.text.ConsoleColors { override val failureColor = magenta }

    class MyColoredSpecification extends Specification { def is = colors(MyColors) ^
       // the failure message will be magenta
       "this is a failing example" ! failure
    }

Note also that the the color support for sbt on Windows is a bit tricky. You need to follow the instructions [here](http://www.marioawad.com/2010/11/16/ansi-command-line-colors-under-windows) then add to your script launching sbt:

```
-Djline.terminal=jline.UnsupportedTerminal
```

### Via IDEA

IntelliJ offers a nice integration with ***specs2***. You can:

 * Execute a specification by selecting its name and pressing CTRL+SHIFT+F10
 * Execute a single example by selecting its description and pressing CTRL+SHIFT+F10

 ![specs2 in Intellij](${IMAGES_DIR}intellij.png)

But also:

 * Provide command-line arguments in the "Test options"
 * "Jump to Test" and "Jump to Source"

### Via JUnit

It is possible to have ***specs2*** specifications executed as JUnit tests. This enables the integration of ***specs2*** with Maven and the JUnit runners of your IDE of choice.

There are 2 ways of enabling a Specification to be executed as a JUnit test: the verbose one and the simpler one. The simplest one is to extend `SpecificationWithJUnit`:

    class MySpecification extends SpecificationWithJUnit {
      def is = // as usual....
    }

You can use the second one if your IDE doesn't work with the first one:

    import org.junit.runner._
    import runner._

    @RunWith(classOf[JUnitRunner])
    class MySpecification extends Specification {
       def is = // as usual....
    }

[*some [tricks](http://code.google.com/p/specs/wiki/RunningSpecs#Run_your_specification_with_JUnit4_in_Eclipse) described on the specs website can still be useful there*]

#### Arguments

You can pass arguments to the `JUnitRunner` for generating the html files for the specifications or for displaying the console output. To do that, you can use the `-Dspecs2.commandline` property and pass it the `html` or `console` values.

### Via Eclipse

There is unfortunately no specific Eclipse plugin at the moment and specifications have to be executed as [JUnit test cases](#Via JUnit).

### Via Maven

You can either:

 - execute specifications as [JUnit test cases](#Via JUnit).
 - use the [Maven specs2 plugin](https://github.com/mmakowski/maven-specs2-plugin) to generate JUnit XML reports, HTML or Markup reports

### With your own

#### Notifier

The `org.specs2.reporter.Notifier` trait can be used to report execution events. It notifies of the following:

 * specification start: the beginning of a specification, with its name
 * specification end: the end of a specification, with its name
 * context start: the beginning of a sub-level when the specification is seen as a tree or Fragments
 * context end: the end of a sub-level when the specification is seen as a tree or Fragments
 * text: any Text fragment that needs to be displayed
 * example start
 * example result: success / failure / error / skipped / pending

All those notifications come with a location (to trace back to the originating fragment in the Specification) and a duration when relevant (i.e. for examples and actions).

##### NotifierRunner

The `NotifierRunner` class can be instantiated with a custom `Notifier` and used from the command line.

##### In sbt

You can also use a custom `Notifier` from inside sbt by passing the `notifier` argument with a `Notifier` implementation class name:

```
sbt> test-only *BinarySpec* -- notifier com.mycompany.reporting.FtpNotifier
```

#### Exporter

The `org.specs2.reporter.Exporter` trait can be used to collect `ExecutedFragments` and report them as desired. The only method to implement is:

    def export(implicit args: Arguments): ExecutingSpecification => ExecutedSpecification

 * `args` is an `Arguments` object created from command line options
 * `ExecutingSpecification` is a list of fragments which might or might not have finished their execution
 * `ExecutedSpecification` must be a list of executed fragments

Please see the API of each class to see how to use them.

##### In sbt

You can use a custom `Exporter` from inside sbt by passing the `exporter` argument with a `Exporter` implementation class name:

    sbt> test-only *BinarySpec* -- exporter com.mycompany.reporting.FtpExporter

    { args.report(color=false).color must beFalse }
  }
