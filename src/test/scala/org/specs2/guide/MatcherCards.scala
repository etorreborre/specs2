The most common type of matcher is ***`beEqualTo`*** to test for equality. There are different ways to use this matcher:

 Matcher                    |  Comment
 -------------------------- | --------------------------
 `1 must beEqualTo(1)      `| the normal way
 `1 must be_==(1)          `| with a shorter matcher
 `1 must_== 1              `| my favorite!
 `1 mustEqual 1            `| if you dislike underscores
 `1 should_== 1            `| for should lovers
 `1 === 1                  `| the ultimate shortcut
 `1 must be equalTo(1)     `| with a literate style

   *with a negation*        |
 -------------------------- |
 `1 must not be equalTo(2) `|
 `1 must_!= 2              `|
 `1 mustNotEqual 2         `|
 `1 must be_!=(2)          `|
 `1 !== 2                  `|

For some other types of equality:

 Matcher                    |  Comment
 -------------------------- | --------------------------
 `be_===                   `| same as `be_==` but can be used with some combinators like `^^^` or `toSeq` because the parameter type is kept
 `be_==~                   `| checks if `(a:A) == (b:A)` when there is an implicit conversion from B (the type of b) to A (the type of a)
 `beTheSameAs              `| checks if `a eq b` (`a must be(b)` also works)
 `beTrue, beFalse          `| shortcuts for Boolean equality
 `a ==== b                 `| similar to `a === b` but will not typecheck if `a` and `b` don't have the same type


Note: the `beEqualTo` matcher is using the regular `==` Scala equality. However in the case of `Arrays`, Scala `==` is just using reference equality, `eq`, for `Arrays`. So the `beEqualTo` matcher has been adapted to transform `Arrays` to `Seqs` before checking for equality, so that `Array(1, 2, 3) === Array(1, 2, 3)` (despite the fact that `Array(1, 2, 3) != Array(1, 2, 3)`).

***Adapting Traversable matchers***

The `contain` and `haveTheSameElementsAs` matchers can be "adapted" to use a different notion of equality than `==` when checking for the existence of elements in a traversable.

`^^ (f: (T, T) => Boolean)` can be used instead of `==`. For example:

         Seq(1, 2, 3) must contain(4, 3, 2) ^^ ((i: Int, j: Int) => i-j <= 1)

will check if each value in the first list is contained in the second list with possibly an error margin of 1.

`^^ (f: T => Matcher[T])` can be used to compare values with a matcher. For example:

         val equalIgnoreCase = (s: String) => be_==(s.toLowerCase)
         Seq("Eric", "Bob") must contain("bob", "eric") ^^ equalIgnoreCase

`^^^ (f: T => S)` can be used to compare values with a function. For example:

         val usersFromDb = Seq(User(id=1, name="eric"), User(id=2, name="Bob"))
         usersFromDb must contain(User(id=0, name="eric"), User(id=0, name="Bob") ^^^ ((_:User).copy(id=0))

_Note_: the last operator used here is slightly different. It is `^^^` instead of simply `^^` because the same function is used to "adapt" both values at the same time. On the other hand the first 2 operators are more or less using a function taking 2 parameters.

object JsonMatchers extends Card {
  def title = "Json"
  def text =  """
 [Json](http://www.json.org) is a simple data format essentially modeling recursive key-values. There are 2 matchers which can be used to verify the presence of appropriate values in Strings representing Json documents:

 * `/(value)` checks if a value is present at the root of the document. This can only be the case if that document is an Array
 * `/(regex)` checks if a value matching the regex is present at the root of the document. This can only be the case if that document is an Array

 * `/(key -> value)` checks if a pair is present at the root of the document. This can only be the case if that document is a Map

 * `*/(value)` checks if a value is present anywhere in the document, either as an entry in an Array, or as the value for a key in a Map

 * `*/(key -> value)` checks if a pair is present anywhere in a Map of the document

Now the interesting part comes from the fact that those matchers can be chained to search specific paths in the Json document. For example, for the following document:

      // taken from an example in the Lift project
      val person = {
        "person": {
          "name": "Joe",
          "age": 35,
          "spouse": {
            "person": {

              "age": 33
            }
          }
        }
      }

You can use these combinations:

      person must /("person") */("person") /("age" -> 33.0) // by default numbers are parsed as Doubles

You can as well use regular expressions instead of values to verify the presence of keys or elements. For example:

 `person must /("p.*".r) */(".*on".r) /("age" -> "\\d+\\.\\d".r)`

}

object ContentMatchers extends Card {
  def title = "Content"
  def text =  """
A few matchers can help us check the contents of files or actually anything containing lines of Strings. We can check that 2 files have the same lines:

 * `(file1, file2) must haveSameLines`
 * `file1 must haveSameLinesAs(file2)`

We can check that the content of one file is contained in another one:

 * `file1 must containLines(file2)`

***LinesContent***

Files are not the only possible source of lines and it is useful to be able to check the content of a `File` with a `Seq[String]`:

 * `file1 must haveSameLinesAs(Seq(line1, line2, line3))`

This is because those 2 types implement the `org.specs2.text.LinesContent` trait, defining:

 * a name for the overall content
 * a method for returning the lines
 * a default method for computing the differences of 2 sequences of lines (in case you need to override this logic)

So if you have a specific type `T` which you can represent as a `Seq[String]`, you can create an implicit `LinesContent` and then you'll be able to use the `ContentMatchers`:

      implicit val linesforMyType: LinesContent[T] = new LinesContent[T] {
        def name(t: T) = "My list of lines"
        def lines(t: T): Seq[String] = ... // your implementation goes here
      }

***Order***

It is possible to relax the constraint by requiring the equality or containment to be true regardless of the order of lines:

 * `(file1, file2) must haveSameLines.unordered`
 * `file1 must haveSameLinesAs(file2).unordered`
 * `file1 must containLines(file2).unordered`

***Missing only***

By default, `(file1, file2) must haveSameLines` will report misplaced lines if any, that is, lines of `f1` which appear in `f2` but not at the right position. However if `file2` is big, this search might degrade the performances. In that case you can turn it off with `missingOnly`:

 `(file1, file2) must haveSameLines.missingOnly`

***Show less differences***

If there are too many differences, you can specify that you only want the first 10:

 * `(file1, file2) must haveSameLines.showOnly(10.differences).unordered`

In the code above `10.differences` builds a `DifferenceFilter` which is merely a filtering function: `(lines1: Seq[String], lines2: Seq[String]) => (Seq[String], Seq[String])`. The parameter `lines1` is the sequence of lines not found in the second content while `lines2` is the sequence of lines not found in the first content.

}

object TerminationMatchers extends Card {
  def title = "Termination"
  def text =  """

Sometimes you just want to specify that a block of code is going to terminate. The `TerminationMatchers` trait is here to help. If you mix in that trait, you can write:

      Thread.sleep(100) must terminate

      // the default is retries=0, sleep=100.millis
      Thread.sleep(100) must terminate(retries=1, sleep=60.millis)

Note that the behaviour of this matcher is a bit different from the `eventually` operator. In this case, we let the current Thread sleep during the given `sleep` time and then we check if the computation is finished, then, we retry for the given number of `retries`.

In a further scenario, we might want to check that triggering another action is able to unblock the first one:

      action1 must terminate.when(action2)
      action1 must terminate.when("starting the second action", action2)
      action1 must terminate(retries=3, sleep=100.millis).when(action2)

When a second action is specified like that, `action1` will be started and `action2` will be started on the first retry. Otherwise, if you want to specify that `action1` can *only* terminate when `action2` is started, you write:

      action1 must terminate.onlyWhen(action2)

 * using the `beASuccess`, `beAFailure`, `succeedOn`, `failOn`, `errorOn` matchers to specify the results of parsing input
 strings. `beAPartialSuccess`, `be aPartialSuccess`, `succeedOn.partially` will allow a successful match only on part of the input
 * using `haveSuccessResult` and `haveFailureMsg` to specify what happens *only* on success or failure. Those matchers accept
 a String or a matcher so that

It is highly desirable to have acyclic dependencies between the packages of a project. This often leads to describing the packages structure as "layered": each package on a layer can only depend on a package on a lower layer. ***specs2*** helps you enforce this design property with specific matchers.

***Layers definition***

First you need to define the packages and their expected dependencies. Mix-in the `org.specs2.specification.Analysis` trait and define, (taking ***specs2*** as an example):

      layers (
        "runner",
        "reporter",
        "specification mutable",
        "mock      form",
        "matcher",
        "execute",
        "reflect    xml  time html",
        "collection control io text main data").withPrefix("org.specs2")

The above expression defines layers as an ordered list of `String`s containing space-separated package names. It is supplemented by a `withPrefix` declaration to factor out the common package prefix between all these packages.

By default, the packages are supposed to correspond to directories in the `src/target/scala-<version>/classes` directory. If your project has a different layout you can declare another target directory:

      layers(...).inTargetDir("out/classes")

**Inclusion/Exclusion**

Every rule has exceptions :-). In some rare cases, it might be desirable to exclude a class from being checked on a given layer. To do this, you can use the `include/exclude` methods on the `Layer` class:

      layers (
        "runner",
        "reporter",
        "specification mutable".exclude("mutable.SpecificationWithJUnit"),
        "mock      form",
        "matcher",
        "execute",
        "reflect  xml  time html",
        "collection control io text main data").withPrefix("org.specs2")

The `include/exclude` methods accept a list of regular expressions to:

- exclude fully qualified class names (generally, only `exclude` will be necessary)
- re-include fully qualified class names if the exclusion list is to big

***Verification***

Now you've defined layers, you can use the `beRespected` matcher to check if all the dependencies are verified:

     val design = layers(...)
     design must beRespected

If some dependencies are not respected:

      those dependencies are not satisfied:
      org.specs2.main x-> org.specs2.io because org.specs2.io.FileSystem -> org.specs2.main.Arguments
      org.specs2.main x-> org.specs2.io because org.specs2.io.FileSystem -> org.specs2.main.ArgumentsArgs

***Layers as an `Example`***

The `Analysis` trait allows to directly embed the layers definition in a `Specification` and turn it into an `Example`:

      class DependenciesSpec extends Specification with Analysis { def is =
        "this is the application design" ^
          layers(
            "gui commandline",
            "controller",
            "backend"
          )
      }

***Alternative implementation***

Another implementation of the same functionality is available through the `org.specs2.analysis.CompilerDependencyFinder` trait. This implementation uses the compiler dependency analysis functionality but needs more time, since it recompiles the sources.

The source files are taken from the `src/main/scala` directory by default but you can change this value by using the `Layers.inSourceDir` method.

While this implementation is slower than the Classycle one, it might retrieve more dependencies, for example when constants are inlined in class files.

Note: since this functionality relies on the scala compiler library, so you need to add it to your build file:

      // use sbt's scalaVersion Setting to define the scala-compiler library version
      libraryDependencies <<= scalaVersion { scala_version => Seq(
        "org.specs2" %% "specs2" % "1.10" % "test",
        "org.scala-lang" % "scala-compiler" % scala_version % "test")
      }
